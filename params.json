{"name":"Crusader' Kings II - Albanian MOD","tagline":"A Mod which corrects some dynasties and adds the ability to play as Albanian","body":"Arberia Mod for CKII\r\n==============================\r\nThis mod adds the possibility to play as Albanian (Arberia) in the Crusader's King II game. For some reason the CKII has completely wiped traces of Arberesh in the game. Some great Albanian families are mixed for Serbian or Greek (See below correction on dynasties). \r\n \r\n-----\r\n## Mod Information\r\n* [GitHub Source](https://github.com/abrahaj/CrusadersKingAlbanianMod)\r\n* [Albforumi - Forum Discussions](http://forumi.shqiperia.com/threads/paradox-crusaders-king-play-as-albanian-arberia.30247/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to use the Mod\r\n\r\n[Download the files](https://github.com/abrahaj/CrusadersKingAlbanianMod/archive/master.zip) and place them under *C:\\Users\\{YOURUSER}\\Documents\\Paradox Interactive\\Crusader Kings II\\mod* in your Windows Version. The same should be done with the Linux version, but the path to the mods dir will change slightly. \r\n\r\n\r\nStart the game and if everything worked fine, you should see the \"Arberia\" Mod in the mods section ![Printscreen ](http://i.imgur.com/4Vb4AfU.png)\r\n\r\nAt the moment the mod relies on the [The Ruler Designer](http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Ruler_Designer) DLC is needed to start the game as an Albanian. I did not investigate much time to change the initial Dynasties, but in theory should be possible to start the game as Albanian without this DLC as well. \r\n\r\nGo to Dyrrachion, and change the leader with the Ruler Design. In the attributes section pick ethnicity Albanian (under Latin) and change the name and dynasty as you please.\r\n\r\nYou do not need this section to play the MOD! This is an informative section in case you want to create the MOD yourself.\r\n-----\r\n## What was changed (or a walkthrough the changes)\r\nIn order to create such a new mod, only a few files are needed to be changed. The instructions on this section should make it easier to create such a mod in the future for other versions of Crusader's Kings.\r\n\r\n### Add Albanian Culture\r\nCultures are defined under the _\\common\\cultures\\00_cultures.txt_ file.\r\nUnder the section Latin I added the following: \r\n\r\n    albanian = {\r\n  \t\tgraphical_culture = frankishgfx\r\n  \t\tcolor = { 0.7 0.7 0.1 }\r\n  \t\t\r\n  \t\tmale_names = {\r\n  \t\t\tAdamat Adan Adomat Adriatik Afrim Agim Agimor Agrin Agron Aidan Aigin Aimir Akal Alaron Alasin Alban Albanor Album Algas Alk Alkan Almarin Alper Altin Alzan Alzen Alzet Amant\r\n  \t\t\tAmantin Amat Aranit Arben Arbenor Arber Arberesh Arberor Arbi Arbian Arbor Ardit Ardian Argjel Argjend Argjendor Arianit Aril Arion Arlind Armir Artar Artas Artian Asdrea \r\n  \t\t\tAstrit Adrian Arber Armant Bardh Bardyl Bato Bekim Bindi Bud Bushat Komin Dardan Dede Dimiter Doda Dukagjin Engjell Faton Gent Gjergj Gjin Gjon Gjon-Leke Gjonja Grgur Gulam \r\n  \t\t\tGuxim Hekuran Ilija Karl Koll Marin Nikoll Kosta Konstandin Kristofor Kujtim Lale Leke Llesh Lul Lulezim Lum Marin Marka Martin Mehill Mentuli Mik Miri Moisi Muriq Muzak\r\n  \t\t\tNaum Nderim Ndue Ndre Pal Paulin Pavle Pirro Pjet Prenk Progon Reposh Shqiptar Shtjefen Simon Strazimir Tanush Teodor Timomir Uke Uran Vango Viktor Vlash Xhan Zeshkan\r\n  \t\t}\r\n  \t\tfemale_names = {\r\n  \t\t\tAferdita Angjelina Derra Diana Donika Drita Fane Fanushe Fluter Hana Komita Lule Majmire Mamice Mara Marena Maria Meri Mrika Pranvera Prenne Rugina Shqipe Teodora Teuta \r\n  \t\t\tVlajka Vojsava Yela Zana Zoje Bajame Bajuke Ballargjenda Baluke Bardha Bardhyle Baresha Bata Batona Begatia Begatime Begatore Belina Besa Besara Besarta Besforta Besiana \r\n  \t\t\tBesime Besmira Besnike Betare Betime Bjeshka Bjeshkana Bleroshe Blerta Bora Borake Bujare Bujaresha\r\n  \t\t}\r\n  \t\t\r\n  \t\tfrom_dynasty_prefix = \"prej \"\r\n  \r\n  \t\tmodifier = default_culture_modifier\r\n  \t\t# Chance of male children being named after their paternal or maternal grandfather, or their father.

You can comply with my decision or change it as you please. To create a De Jure Kingdom, one has to modify the organization of landed_tiles under _/common/landed\\_titles/landed\\_titles.txt_\r\n\r\nUnder this file, find the section which starts with *e_byzantium = {* (for Byzantine Empire) and create inside this section the following kingdom:\r\n\r\n    k_illirikum = {\r\n    \t\tcolor={ 247 77 54 }\r\n    \t\tcolor2={ 136 157 23 }\r\n    \t\tculture = albanian\r\n    \r\n    \t\td_dyrrachion = {\r\n    \t\t\tcolor={ 137 27 99 }\r\n    \t\t\tcolor2={ 255 255 20 }\r\n    \t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\tcapital = 470 # Dyrrachion\r\n    \t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\tc_strymon = {\r\n    \t\t\t\tcolor={ 139 29 101 }\r\n    \t\t\t\tcolor2={ 255 255 20 }\r\n    \t\t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_skopje = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_strumica = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_veles = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_prilep = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_prosek = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_trikves = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_kocane = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_kratovo = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\tc_ochrid = {\r\n    \t\t\t\tcolor={ 141 31 103 }\r\n    \t\t\t\tcolor2={ 255 255 20 }\r\n    \t\t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\t\tgreek = \"Lychnidos\"\r\n    \t\t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_debar = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_ohrid = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tgreek = \"Lychnidos\"\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_kastoria = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_kicevo = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_svetigrad = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_bitola = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_tomot = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_krusevo = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\tc_dyrrachion = {\r\n    \t\t\t\tcolor={ 143 33 105 }\r\n    \t\t\t\tcolor2={ 255 255 20 }\r\n    \t\t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\t\titalian = \"Durazzo\"\r\n    \t\t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_durazzo = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tgreek = \"Dyrrhachion\"\r\n    \t\t\t\t\titalian = \"Durazzo\"\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_chounavia = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_valona = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_kruje = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tgreek = Krougia\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_elbasan = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_geziq = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_spinarizza = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_beat = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\td_epirus = {\r\n    \t\t\tcolor={ 134 63 109 }\r\n    \t\t\tcolor2={ 255 255 20 }\r\n    \t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\tcapital = 473 # Arta\r\n    \t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\tc_epeiros = {\r\n    \t\t\t\tcolor={ 138 67 113 }\r\n    \t\t\t\tcolor2={ 255 255 20 }\r\n    \t\t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_butrint = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tgreek = \"Bouthroton\"\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_paramythia = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_ioannina = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_sopot = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tgreek = \"Koritsa\"\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_pogonia = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_gjirokaster = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tgreek = Argyrokastron\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_igoumenitsa = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_sagiada = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\tc_arta = {\r\n    \t\t\t\tcolor={ 142 71 117 }\r\n    \t\t\t\tcolor2={ 255 255 20 }\r\n    \t\t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_preveza = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_angelokastron = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_arta = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_agnanta = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_thomokastron = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_vonitsza = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_vlacherna = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_rogoi = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\tc_cephalonia = {\r\n    \t\t\t\tcolor={ 146 75 121 }\r\n    \t\t\t\tcolor2={ 255 255 20 }\r\n    \t\t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\t\tturkish = \"Iyonya\"\r\n    \t\t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_corfu = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_lefkas = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tturkish = \"Ayamavra\"\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_palaiofrourio = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_kefalonia = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_zante = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_paxos = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\titalian = \"Passo\"\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tturkish = \"Paksa\"\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_ithaca = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tturkish = \"Fiaki\"\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\tb_cerigo = {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tturkish = \"Ã‡uha\"\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n*!IMPORTANT!*\r\n\r\n1.
